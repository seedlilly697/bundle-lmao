block.whert-tech-discharge.name = Discharge
block.whert-tech-jetstream.name = Jetstream
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conduit.name = Omnidirectional bridge conduit
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conveyor.name = Omnidirectional bridge conveyor
block.whert-tech-thermal-centrifuge.name = Thermal centrifuge
block.whert-tech-vertex.name = Vertex

block.whert-tech-discharge.description = A larger, more advanced version of Arc. Fires powerful arcs of electricity at enemies.
block.whert-tech-jetstream.description = Next generation of Wave. Shoots high-pressure streams of liquids at enemies. 
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conduit.description = Unlike regular bridge conduits, this can link to others in any direction, not only axis aligned ones. Also it is a bit longer. Can [red]not[] be used in some case where regular one can be used, because it outputs liquids to all possible directions.
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conveyor.description = Unlike regular bridge conveyors, this can link to others in any direction, not only axis aligned ones. Also it is a bit longer. Can [red]not[] be used in some case where regular one can be used, because it outputs items to all possible directions.
block.whert-tech-thermal-centrifuge.description = An advanced separator able to extract tiniest amounts of rare resources (such as thorium) from slag. Due to separation process complexity, sometimes outputs sand. Requires massive amounts of power to function.
block.whert-tech-vertex.description = An advanced extremely powerful assault artillery cannon. Shots chunks of charged surge alloy at enemies in manually configurable spot. Not efficient as defensive turret.
